\title{Normalize an interaction term by sorting its components alphabetically.
This ensures \code{hp:disp} and \code{disp:hp} are treated as the same term.}
\usage{
normalize_term(term)
}
\description{
This works because R interaction terms are commutative (a:b == b:a),
but R's \code{terms()} function may reorder components alphabetically.
