\description{
These are hypothetical data for a small study comparing the effectiveness of three different
teachers. Each teacher was randomly assigned a group of 35 high school students and asked to
teach a 5-day unit on a new science topic for which none of the students had any prior knowledge.
All three teachers used the same curriculum materials and lesson plans, and student learning was
assessed using a common 30-item test at the end of the unit. The research question was: Were some
teachers more effective than others? Did teachers differ in the amount of learning they were able
to produce in their students?
